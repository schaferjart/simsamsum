/**
 * @module data/calculations
 * This module is intended for business logic calculations, such as volume and cost.
 * Currently, the main calculation logic is in `computeDerivedFields` in `data-processor.js`.
 * This file is a placeholder for future, more complex calculation logic.
 */

// This file is currently empty because the primary calculation logic
// (computeDerivedFields) is tightly coupled with data processing and
// flow analysis, and resides in `data-processor.js`.
//
// If more specific, isolated business logic calculations are needed
// (e.g., detailed cost breakdowns, scenario analysis), they should be added here.

// Example of a function that could live here:
/*
export function calculateTotalCost(nodes) {
    return nodes.reduce((total, node) => {
        return total + (node.costValue || 0);
    }, 0);
}
