# Refactoring Recommendations

Based on analysis of the codebase after the initial UI and Core refactoring, here are the recommended next steps for improving code organization and maintainability.

## Priority Rankings

🔴 **High Priority** - Large, complex files with multiple responsibilities  
🟡 **Medium Priority** - Moderate complexity, some refactoring benefits  
🟢 **Low Priority** - Small files or already well-organized

---

## 🔴 High Priority Files

### 1. `src/js/data.js` (768 lines)

**Current Responsibilities:**
- Sample data constants
- Expression parsing and token extraction
- Variable resolution and evaluation
- Data processing and transformation
- Volume/cost calculations
- Connection verification
- Import/Export functionality
- Derived field computation

**Recommended Refactoring:**

```
src/js/data/
├── index.js                    # Barrel export
├── sample-data.js              # Sample workflow data
├── expression-parser.js        # Token extraction and parsing
├── variable-resolver.js        # Variable resolution logic
├── data-processor.js           # processData function
├── calculations.js             # Volume and cost calculations
├── import-export.js            # JSON import/export
└── validators.js               # Connection verification
```

**Benefits:**
- Separation of concerns (data vs. logic)
- Easier testing of expression parsing
- Reusable calculation logic
- Clear import/export boundaries

---

### 2. `src/js/render.js` (500 lines)

**Current Responsibilities:**
- SVG initialization and setup
- D3 element rendering (nodes, links, labels)
- Visual updates (positions, highlights, selections)
- Grid display management
- Text rotation handling

**Recommended Refactoring:**

```
src/js/render/
├── index.js                    # Barrel export
├── svg-setup.js                # initVisualization, markers

├── link-renderer.js            # Link/connection rendering
├── label-renderer.js           # Text label rendering
├── visual-updates.js           # Highlight, selection, position updates
├── grid-renderer.js            # Grid display logic
└── text-transforms.js          # Text rotation utilities
```

**Benefits:**
- Clearer rendering pipeline

- Better separation of D3 operations

---

### 3. `src/js/layouts.js` (450 lines)

**Current Responsibilities:**
- Layout selection and application
- Force-directed layout
- Hierarchical layout (with and without orthogonal routing)
- Circular layout
- Grid layout
- Manual grid layout
- Link normalization ("linkify")

**Recommended Refactoring:**

```
src/js/layouts/
├── index.js                    # Barrel export, applyLayout dispatcher
├── force-layout.js             # Force-directed algorithm
├── hierarchical-layout.js      # Tree-based layouts
├── circular-layout.js          # Circular arrangement
├── grid-layout.js              # Auto and manual grid layouts
└── layout-utils.js             # linkify, common utilities
```

**Benefits:**
- Each layout algorithm is self-contained
- Easier to add new layout types

### 4. `src/js/filtering.js` (439 lines)

**Current Responsibilities:**
- Property path resolution (getProperty)

├── selection-handler.js        # Click and rectangle selection
├── keyboard-handler.js         # Keyboard shortcuts
├── zoom-handler.js             # Zoom and pan logic
└── hover-handler.js            # Mouse hover effects
```

**Benefits:**
- Each interaction type is isolated
- Easier to debug drag issues
- Clear keyboard shortcut registry
- Better separation of mouse/keyboard events

---

## 🟡 Medium Priority Files

### 6. `src/js/fileManager.js` (301 lines)

**Current State:** Already well-organized with clear functions for file operations.

**Optional Enhancement:**
```
src/js/file-manager/
├── index.js
├── normalize.js          # Element/connection normalization
├── api-client.js         # Server communication
└── persistence.js        # Save/load operations
```

**Verdict:** Only refactor if adding significant new file management features.

---

### 7. `src/js/selection.js` (169 lines)

**Current State:** `SelectionManager` class is already well-encapsulated.

**Optional Enhancement:**
- Could be moved to `src/js/core/selection-manager.js` to group with other core logic
- Already follows single responsibility principle

**Verdict:** Good as-is, minor relocation possible.

---

### 8. `src/js/layoutManager.js` (165 lines)

**Current State:** Handles layout file saving/loading from server.

**Recommendation:** 
- Could be merged into a layouts module or renamed to `layout-persistence.js` for clarity
- Functions are already well-defined

**Verdict:** Minor improvement, not urgent.

---

### 9. `src/js/export.js` (145 lines)

**Current State:** PDF export functionality is already isolated.

**Verdict:** Already well-organized, no refactoring needed.

---

## 🟢 Low Priority / Already Good

### 10. `src/js/utils.js` (164 lines)
- Already a utilities collection
- Functions are diverse but small
- Good as-is

### 11. `src/js/gitInfo.js` (53 lines)
- Small, focused file
- No refactoring needed

### 12. `src/js/theme.js` (15 lines)
- Already refactored into `ui/theme-manager.js`
- This file appears to be legacy and can be **deleted**

---

## 🗑️ Files to Delete (Legacy/Backup)

These files appear to be backups or corrupted versions:

1. **`src/js/interactions_backup.js` (323 lines)** - Backup file, remove after verifying current `interactions.js` works
2. **`src/js/interactions_corrupted.js` (401 lines)** - Corrupted file, safe to delete
3. **`src/js/theme.js` (15 lines)** - Superseded by `ui/theme-manager.js`

**Action:** Remove these files and clean up imports.

---

## Recommended Refactoring Order

### Phase 1: High-Impact Modules (2-3 days)
1. **`data.js` → `data/`** - Most complex, biggest impact
2. **`render.js` → `render/`** - Core visualization logic
3. **`layouts.js` → `layouts/`** - Clear boundaries between layouts

### Phase 2: Interaction & Filtering (1-2 days)
4. **`filtering.js` → `filtering/`** - Used heavily, worth modularizing
5. **`interactions.js` → `interactions/`** - Complex event handling

### Phase 3: Cleanup (1 day)
6. Delete legacy files (`*_backup.js`, `*_corrupted.js`, `theme.js`)
7. Minor refactoring of `fileManager.js`, `selection.js`, `layoutManager.js` if needed
8. Update all imports across the codebase
9. Verify all functionality works

---

## Expected Benefits

### Code Quality
- **Reduced complexity**: Files under 200 lines each
- **Single responsibility**: Each module has one clear purpose
- **Better testability**: Isolated functions are easier to unit test

### Developer Experience
- **Faster navigation**: Find code by logical grouping
- **Easier debugging**: Smaller scope to search
- **Clearer dependencies**: Barrel exports show module boundaries

### Maintainability
- **Safer changes**: Modifications don't ripple unexpectedly
- **Easier onboarding**: New developers can understand modules independently
- **Better documentation**: Smaller files are easier to document

### Performance
- **Tree shaking**: Unused exports can be eliminated
- **Code splitting**: Potential for lazy loading modules
- **Build optimization**: Smaller chunks for faster loading

---

## Implementation Strategy

### For Each Refactoring:

1. **Create module directory** with `index.js` barrel file
2. **Extract functions** into logical sub-modules
3. **Update barrel exports** to maintain API compatibility
4. **Update imports** in dependent files
5. **Test thoroughly** - run full test suite
6. **Commit with clear message** describing changes

### Testing Checklist:
- ✅ All layouts work correctly
- ✅ Filtering and styling apply properly
- ✅ Drag and drop functions
- ✅ Multi-select works
- ✅ Export to PDF works
- ✅ Data saves and loads
- ✅ No console errors
- ✅ Performance is maintained

---

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ **Don't over-modularize**: A 50-line file doesn't need to be split  
❌ **Don't break APIs unnecessarily**: Use barrel exports to maintain compatibility  
❌ **Don't forget tests**: Update tests as you refactor  
❌ **Don't refactor everything at once**: Do it incrementally  
❌ **Don't duplicate code**: Extract shared utilities properly

---

## Success Metrics

- ✅ No file over 300 lines (except generated code)
- ✅ Each module has a clear, single responsibility
- ✅ Barrel exports provide clean, consistent APIs
- ✅ All existing functionality works unchanged
- ✅ No performance degradation
- ✅ Improved code coverage (easier to test)
